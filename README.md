There is an app for a customer and a manager as the functionalities are different.

### Customer App

Asks a Customer to choose an item to purchase from the generated table of stock
The item is selected by a unique itemId.

Once the user enters the correct information then their total is displayed, the stock value for the selected is reduced in the database(mySQL) and the connection terminates.

If the user enters something incorrect, say a non numeric value, for either the itemId or the quantity needed then they will receive an error message and will be asked to start over

In the case of this example we see that the amount of Xbox units remaining was decreased by one because the user chose to buy a Xbox.

If the user enters a quantity to purchase that is larger than what is in stock the user gets an erro and is asked to re-enter the ItemId and the quantity they need.

### Manager App

Upon initiating the program the manage is asked to choose one of four choices.

Upon selecting 'View Products for Sale' a table of all the products will be generated.

Upon selecting 'View Low inventory' a table of all the products with a quantity less than 5 will be generated. I adjusted my database to make this screenshot as my stock was previous quite healthy.

Upon selecting 'Add to Inventory' a user is asked to select the id of the item he wants to add stock to and the amount of stock to add. Barbies were previously in the low inventory and now we see it has been movd out of that due to the amount being increased to 24.

Upon selecting 'Add New Product' the user is asked to enter relevant information and when the user utlizes 'View Products for Sale' they will see the new product with anew unique id generated by the database.

Note: The user input validation i.e. checking for numeric values in the appropriate places is done for both Apps at all stages.
